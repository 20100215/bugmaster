# 🐞 BugMaster: AI Code Debugging Game

A Streamlit-based game to help developers sharpen their debugging skills on AI-generated buggy Python code — powered by LLaMA3 (via Groq API).

---

## 🧠 Overview

**BugMaster** is a game where developers debug broken Python code generated by a large language model (LLM). Each round presents you with AI-generated code that *almost works* — your job is to fix it until it passes all hidden test cases.

---

## 💡 Motivation

Modern developers increasingly rely on AI to write code — but AI isn't always right. In fact, AI can generate *convincing but subtly broken* logic. This game helps developers build the essential skill of **debugging AI-generated code**, making them faster, smarter, and more resilient coders.

> ⚠️ Vibe coders must learn how to debug AI code — it’s a critical 2020s skill.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Code Editor:** `st.text_area` (previously `streamlit-code-editor`)
- **AI Backend:** [Groq API](https://groq.com/) using **LLaMA3**
- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Prompting Engine:** Structured prompting to generate original, buggy, and testable code

## 🚀 How to Run the App

### ✅ Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bugmaster.git
   cd bugmaster
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set your Groq API key:**
   - Option 1: Set it in your environment
     ```bash
     export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   - Option 2: Hardcode it directly inside the app (not recommended for production)

### ▶️ Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🤖 Behind the Scenes

- Prompts are sent in two stages:
  1. **Generate clean & tested code** with embedded tests
  2. **Introduce subtle bugs** (syntax or logic) into the clean code
- Only the **buggy portion** is shown to the user; hidden tests are stored and evaluated behind the scenes.

---

## 🧪 Example Flow

1. User selects **"Medium"**
2. AI generates a clean, tested function (e.g., `reverse_string`)
3. AI then introduces a bug (e.g., off-by-one error or logic flaw)
4. User sees only the buggy version and edits it
5. Upon submit, the backend runs hidden tests to validate the fix

## 📎 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Groq API key
- Internet access (to call LLM)
